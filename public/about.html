<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a keen interest in the stock market, where I've actively engaged in investing and expanding my financial knowledge. This passion led me to take on a finance internship, where I gained hands-on experience in analyzing market trends and understanding the intricacies of financial management.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy watching Thai dramas, which offer a unique blend of storytelling and cultural insights. This hobby not only entertains me but also enriches my understanding of different narratives and perspectives.</p>

<p>I also love traveling, with Bangkok being one of my favorite destinations. The vibrant culture, delicious food, and bustling city life draw me back time and again, making each visit a memorable experience.</p>
